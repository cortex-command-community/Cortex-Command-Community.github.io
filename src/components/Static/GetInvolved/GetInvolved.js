      <h1>Get Involved</h1>
      <p>The Cortex Command Community Project (CCCP) is always looking for new hands and heads to make the game what it always should have been. Our aim is to create an excellent RTS-hybrid side-scroller, with tons of cool content, including revamped factions and (eventually) a full campaign.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In terms of skills, we're looking for C++ programmers or people who are willing to take the time to learn it. More artists, sound creators, lua scripters or CC modders are also totally welcome. We could also definitely use more dedicated playtesters and help with balancing everything (especially as the project gets farther along), so if you'd like to join in, we'd be happy to have you. If you <a href="https://discord.gg/TSU6StNQUG">join us in Discord,</a> we can help you get everything set up so you can contribute to the glory of the CCCP!</p>
