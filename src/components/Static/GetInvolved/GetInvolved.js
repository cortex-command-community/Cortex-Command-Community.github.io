				The Cortex Command Community Project (CCCP) is always looking for new
				hands and heads to make the game what it always should have been. Our
				aim is to create an excellent RTS-hybrid side-scroller, with tons of
				cool content, including revamped factions and (eventually) a full
				campaign.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				In terms of skills, we're looking for C++ programmers or people who are
				willing to take the time to learn it. More artists, sound creators, lua
				scripters or CC modders are also totally welcome. We could also
				definitely use more dedicated playtesters and help with balancing
				everything (especially as the project gets farther along), so if you'd
				like to join in, we'd be happy to have you. If you{' '}
